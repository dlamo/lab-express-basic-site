        <h2>A Challenging Life</h2>
        <p>Stephen was born in England on Jan. 8, 1942</p>
        <p>He attended University College, Oxford, where he studied physics</p>
        <p>Hawking went on to Cambridge to research cosmology, the study of the universe as a whole.</p>
        <p>In early 1963 Hawking was diagnosed with motor neuron disease (ALS)</p>
        <p>He was not expected to live more than two years, he was not supposed to finish his doctorate</p>
        <p>He was able to accomplish it and further so</p>
        <p>As the disease spread, Hawking became less mobile and began using a wheelchair</p>
        <p>In 1985, an emergency tracheotomy caused his total loss of speech</p>
        <p>A speech-generating device constructed at Cambridge, combined with a software program, served as his electronic voice, allowing Hawking to select his words by moving the muscles in his cheek</p>

        <h2>A brilliant mind</h2>
        <p>Hawking continued at Cambridge after his graduation, serving as a research fellow and later as a professional fellow</p>
        <p>Over the course of his career, Hawking studied the basic laws governing the universe</p>
        <p>He demonstrated that Albert Einstein's Theory of General Relativity suggests that space and time began at the birth of the universe and ends within black holes</p>
        <p>This demonstration implies that Einstein's theory and quantum theory must be united</p>
        <p>Using the two theories together, Hawking also determined that black holes are not totally dark but instead emit radiation</p>
        <p>In 2014, Hawking revised his theory</p>
        <p>Hawking also proposed that the universe itself has no boundary</p>
        <p>Hawking died at his home in Cambridge, England, on 14 March 2018, at the age of 76</p>
